const body = `Performance reviews are coming up, and you’re a key part of making them effective and successful.
Your direct reports should reach out to you to schedule their performance review meeting. If they haven’t scheduled a meeting with you , please speak to them to make sure they schedule it on time.
Before your meetings, please fill out the attached employee evaluation sheet.
During the performance review, allow each direct report to lead the conversation by discussing their self-evaluation. From there, you’re invited to add your feedback and answer their questions.
If you need any guidance or have any questions, feel free to reach out to HR.
Thank you for your help!`
